# ITK 5.4.0 DICOM Slice Secondary Capture Metadata

This example demonstrates improved DICOM metadata handling in ITK 5.4.0. For more information, see the [ITK 5.4.0 release notes](https://docs.itk.org/en/latest/releases/5.4.0.html).

We read an RGB slice of the Visible Human Male that was generated and [stored on the NIH Imaging Data Commons archive](https://portal.imaging.datacommons.cancer.gov/explore/filters/?Modality_op=OR&Modality=XC&collection_id=nlm_visible_human_project
).

To reproduce, [install pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/#installation), then:

```sh
pixi run start
```
